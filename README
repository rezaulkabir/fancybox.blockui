Extending FancyBox to give BlockUI JQuery Plugin functionalities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fancybox is an excellent plugin that provides Lightbox type functionality on your website using JQuery. 
I love this Plugin since it provides greater control than any other similar tools. You can display almost 
anything in lightbox fashion yet have excellent control on how everything is done.

However, sometime you just need to block UI while you are doing something showing a Progress animation or 
just need to show simple prompt. BlockUI is one such great JQuery plugin that does exact this. Although you 
could use this to show simple Text messages but main goal here is to block the screen with an overlay while 
you are doing something in the background or you need a feedback from user.

I wanted to use Fancybox but have the BlockUI functionality on it. This can be easily achieved by using onStart, 
onClose callbacks. Fancybox already comes with an default progress animation that could be used as well. 
Having Fancybox doing the BlockUI functionalities  allows not to load an extra javascript. 
Moreover both Plugin adds extra HTML code on the page as well for almost same purpose which seems to be overkill to me. 
So, I have written a simple Plugin that extends the functionality of Fancybox with two new functions blockUI and unlockUI.



How to Load:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have tested the plugin on fancybox v1.3.4. Load the plugin after Fancybox. example:


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js" />  
<script type="text/javascript" src="../fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js"/> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.fancybox.blockui_1.1.0.js"/> 



Default Usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

$fancybox.blockUI();


Blocks the UI with gray overlay. Default behavior to hide the UI overlay is to click on the overlay. Use fancybox param to override this behavior.




$fancybox.unblockUI();


hides the Blocked overlay




Extended usage with parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

$fancybox.blockUI(param)


'param' is optional. this is a key/value object. You can also pass all existing fancybox parameters to override the default behaviors on this plugin. For example, to disable the click functionality that hides the overlay UI pass {hideOnOverlayClick: false} as parameter.




All standard fancy box parameters could be passed to override the defaul values and behaviors. 




Three new Key/value has been introduced to give some new behavior related to blockUI

Key                               Default value                Description
scrollToTop                       false                        scroll the window to top before showing the overlay.                                                                                                                                         
                                                               This is exactly same as window.parent.scroll(0,0);
timeout                           false                        hides the overlay after given time in milliseconds. 
hideProgressImage                 false                        hides the default progress animation
